# How to Run the Recipes React App
After moving the deployment to a backend server, separate from the provided create-react-app server,
the following must be done to run the Recipes React App:

### `cd recipes`
This changes the directory to the recipes folder. Next, run:

### `npm install`
This installs node_modules and packages to run the pages.

### `npm run build`
This creates an optimized version of the code.

### `cd ..`
This changes the directory to outside the recipes folder. Finally, run:

### `node server/index.js`
This will create a port for the Recipes React App to run on.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.


# Tasty Recipes Website

There is a main landing page that includes a navigation bar for 7 different recipes\
with an image, a short summary, and a button that takes you to the detail page for each recipe.\
A navigation bar can be found at the top of all the pages that can take you back to the\

Each detail page includes an image of the dish, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step\
